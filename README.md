This repository contains my code for my research under Dr. Aaron YS Kim. This research seeks to accomplish three main goals:

1.) Use Monte Carlo Simulation of the ARMA-GARCH-NTS and Stochcastic Normal Tempered Stable ARMA-GARCH option pricing models to create a map of parameter vectors to their resulting call and put prices.
2.) Develop a host of candidate surrogate models capable of quickly and accurately predicting the resulting call or put price from a parameter vector. Neural networks and grid interpolation are of particular interest due to their ability to maintain arbitrage free predictions.
3.) Compare the performance of these surrogates on real world option data to the Monte Carlo method.
